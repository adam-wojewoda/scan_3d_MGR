We are reading with SPI, trying to get as many samples a sec as possible.
1. Wait for call from server PC with info about measurement (OPC UA)
2. Check if server is ready for the start of measurement (InfluxDb)
3. Wait for start call (OPC UA)
4. Initialize sensor and read WHO_AM_I registry (0Fh)
	The registry should give us 0x01101011 as a response	
5. Write config to sensor
	- 02h - pulling up or down the pins (optional)
	- 10h - accelerometer range
		0b1010_11_00 -> 6.66 kHz, 8g, unfiltered
  	- 11h - gyroscope range
		0b1010_10_00 -> 6.66 kHz, 1000dps
	- 12h - data update mode (optional)
		0b01000100
6. Send measuring flag (OPC UA)
7a. Read data in loop as fast as You can (DOF Sensors)
7b. Send packages with data to server (influxDb)
7c. Wait for end measurement command (Server or hardware)
